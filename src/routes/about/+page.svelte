	<p>
		Hello! Dear visitors! 
	</p>
	<h2>
		My name is Sung Jun, Hwang.<br><br>

		I am a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> with 20 years of experience.<br>
		For the past 10 years, I have mostly worked on Java and Spring-based projects. <br>
		However, I am very interested in several languages and related frameworks, <br>
		such as Node.js, Python, Go, Flutter, and Dart.<br><br>
		
		If you want to know more about me, please take a look at this website.	<br>

	<!-- <p>
		I am passionate about software development and love developing innovative and creative solutions. 
		Rather than focusing on a specific technology stack, we are interested in a variety of fields and strive to create better software through continuous learning and development.
		You can check my experience in the Skills and Carrer menu.
		Based on an open mind to new technologies and problem-solving skills, our goal is to develop software that provides value to customers and users. Please take a look at my work through my portfolio, and if you have any capabilities or projects you would like to work on, please contact me at any time.
		Thank you
